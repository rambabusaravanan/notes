### Encryption/Decryption
- Encrypt: Use public key to encrypt
- Decrypt: Use private key to decrypt

### Sign/Verify Signature
Creating and verifying signatures uses the public/private keypair in an operation different from encryption and decryption.

- Sign: A signature is created using the **private key** of the signer.
- Verify: The signature is verified using the corresponding **public key**
